[This Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcoraddatz/homebridge/) helps you to easily setup [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) on your Synology, but also runs on QNAP devices or Raspberry Pies. If you're using a Synology, please make sure to run at least DSM 6, otherwise you [might have to go the harder way](https://marcoraddatz.com/en/2016/07/13/run-homebridge-on-a-synology/) via SSH/shell scripts.
